        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I've been using this chocolate frosting recipe forever, and several friends now use it as their "favorite frosting!" It's smooth, creamy and not-too-dark. I just wanted to share it with chocolate lovers everywhere! It will frost, but not fill, an 8- or 9-inch layer cake.</p>
